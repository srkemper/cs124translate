Not to forget there ever was a man who shortly after birth he was baptized in the Catholic faith with the name Faustino Saralegui, and today provides others' eyes his last sunset in front of a naked window overlooking a small park.

I know nothing, but I can imagine wandering from early morning aimlessly through the cold streets of Manhattan, unable to wait for your friend's house to the time you should leave the house came, to find a taxi and get to restaurant.

Only then, from the safety of moving car you notice the huge red suitcase that dragged the guy who had been screaming incomprehensible words pointing suitcase.

Every time I informed them my progress, which I thought important, they wrote down their comments on my moods.
